# 1.Question 1: Remove Duplicates from a String Problem Statement
# You are given a string that may contain repeated characters. 
# Write a Python program to remove all duplicate characters from the string and return 
# a new string that contains only the first occurrence of each character, while preserving the original order. 
# Input A single string s containing letters, digits, or symbols. Output A string with duplicate characters removed. 
# Sample Input 
# programming 
# Sample Output 
# programin
# Explanation 
# The characters r, g, and m appear more than once. Only their first occurrence is kept. 
# Order of characters remains the same as the input.
# s = input("aenter the string:")
# result = ""
# seen = set()
# for ch in s:
#     if ch not in seen:
#         result+= ch
#         seen.add(ch)
# print(result)

# right angled trangle
# for i in range(1,10):
#     print('* '*i)


# n=5
# for i in range(1,n+1):
#     for j in range(1,i+1):
#         print('*', end = '')
# for j in range(2*(n-i)):
#     print('', end = '')
# for j in range(1, i+1):
#     print('*', end= ' ')
#     print()
    
# for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
#     for j in range(1, i+1):
#         print('*', end= ' ')
#     for j in range(2*(n-i)):
#         print(' ', end= '')
#     for j in range(1,i+1):
#         print('*', end= ' ')
#     print()
