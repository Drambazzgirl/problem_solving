# 1.Given an array count the number of elements higher than the average of the array?
# Assume all the elements inside the array are greater than zero. 
# Bonus: If validation for the input array is possible, you can include 

# ```python
# # test case 1
# Input: [10,20,30,40,50]
# Output: 2
# arr = [10,10,10,10,10]
# total = 0
# count = 0
# for i in range(len(arr)):
#     total = total + arr[i]
# avg = total / len(arr)
# for i in range(len(arr)):
#     if arr[i] > avg:
#         count += 1
# print(count)

# 2.Write a Python program to remove all duplicate characters from a given string and return the result.
#   The final string should contain only the first occurrence of each character, in the same order.

# ```python
# #test case 1
# Sample Input: 'programming'
# Sample Output: 'progamin'
# String = "Freshworks"
# Spc_str = " "
# for i in String:
#     if i not in  Spc_str:
#         Spc_str += i
# print(Spc_str)


# 3.Write a Python program to find and print the longest word in a given sentence.

# ```python
# Sample Input: "Python makes programming enjoyable"
# Sample Output: "programming"
# ```
